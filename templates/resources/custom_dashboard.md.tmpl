# orcasecurity_custom_dashboard (Resource)

Provides a custom dashboard resource.

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/resources/custom_dashboard/example_1.tf"}}

## Built-in Widget IDs

Use these IDs in `widgets_config` when adding Orca built-in widgets to a dashboard. Widget IDs are slugified versions of the names from [Orca Dashboard Widgets](https://docs.orcasecurity.io/v1/docs/available-dashboard-widgets). For custom widgets, use the `id` attribute of an `orcasecurity_custom_widget` resource.

| Widget Name (Orca docs)          | Widget ID                               |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Accounts (Inventory)             | `cloud-accounts-inventory`              |
| Security Score Benchmark         | `security-score-benchmark`              |
| Security Score Breakdown         | `security-score-breakdown`              |
| Alerts on Exposed Assets         | `alerts-on-exposed-assets`              |
| Top Attack Path Entry Points     | `top-attack-path-entry-points`          |
| Top Attack Path Target Assets    | `top-attack-path-target-assets`         |
| Alerts Pending Action            | `alerts-pending-action`                 |
| Alerts by Risk Level             | `alerts-by-severity`                    |
| Risk Categories Alerts Over Time | `risk-categories-alerts-over-time`      |
| Created & Resolved Alerts        | `created-and-resolved-alerts-over-time` |
| Fixable Vulnerabilities          | `fixable-vulnerabilities`               |
| Vulnerable Assets (by max CVSS)  | `assets-max-cvss`                       |
| Compliance Overview              | `compliance-overview`                   |
| Top Alerts                       | `top-alerts`                            |
| Major Insights                   | `major-insights`                        |
| Alert Inventory                  | `alert-inventory`                       |
| Asset Inventory                  | `asset-inventory`                       |

For other widgets, derive the ID by converting the name to lowercase and replacing spaces with hyphens (e.g., "Top Sensitive Data Findings" → `top-sensitive-data-findings`).

## Using Custom Widgets

Custom widgets are created with the `orcasecurity_custom_widget` resource. The widget receives an `id` from Orca after creation (computed attribute). Reference that `id` in `widgets_config` to add the custom widget to a dashboard. You can mix built-in and custom widgets in the same dashboard.

**1. Create the custom widget:**

{{tffile "examples/resources/custom_dashboard/example_2.tf"}}

**2. Add it to a dashboard using its `id`:**

{{tffile "examples/resources/custom_dashboard/example_3.tf"}}

See the [orcasecurity_custom_widget](custom_widget.md) resource for full schema and more examples (table-type, alert widgets, etc.).

## Importing

Existing dashboards created in the Orca UI can be imported into Terraform.

**Get the dashboard ID:** Open the dashboard in the Orca UI and check the URL. The dashboard ID (preference ID) appears in the URL path.

**Import command:**

```bash
terraform import orcasecurity_custom_dashboard.<resource_name> <dashboard_id>
```

Example:

```bash
terraform import orcasecurity_custom_dashboard.my_dashboard abc123-def456-ghi789
```

Add a placeholder resource block to your configuration first, then run the import. After import, run `terraform plan` to align your configuration with the imported state.
