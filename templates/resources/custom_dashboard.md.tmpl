# orcasecurity_custom_dashboard (Resource)

Provides a custom dashboard resource.

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/resources/custom_dashboard/example_1.tf"}}

## Built-in Widget IDs

Use these IDs in `widgets_config` when adding Orca built-in widgets to a dashboard. To get the built-in widget IDs, see [Orca Dashboard Widgets](https://docs.orcasecurity.io/docs/orca-dashboard-widgets-new) (V2) or [Orca Dashboard Widgets (V1)](https://docs.orcasecurity.io/v1/docs/available-dashboard-widgets) (legacy). For custom widgets, use the `id` attribute of an `orcasecurity_custom_widget` resource.

## Widget Sizes

Each widget has a `size` in `widgets_config`. Values correspond to dashboard width:

| Value | Label        | Width (Legacy/V1) | Width (V2)     |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| `sm` | Small (S)     | One-third         | One-third      |
| `md` | Medium (M)    | Two-thirds        | Two-thirds     |
| `lg` | Large (L)     | Entire width      | Three-quarters |
| `xl` | Ex-Large (XL) | N/A               | Entire width   |

Legacy Dashboard Builder (V1) supports `sm`, `md`, `lg`. The new Dashboard Builder (V2) adds `xl`.

## Using Custom Widgets

Custom widgets are created with the `orcasecurity_custom_widget` resource. The widget receives an `id` from Orca after creation (computed attribute). You can mix built-in and custom widgets in the same dashboard:

| Type     | How to reference in `widgets_config`                          |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Built-in | String ID from Orca UI, e.g. `"cloud-accounts-inventory"`     |
| Custom   | `orcasecurity_custom_widget.<resource_name>.id`               |

**1. Create the custom widget:**

{{tffile "examples/resources/custom_dashboard/example_2.tf"}}

**2. Add it to a dashboard using its `id`:**

{{tffile "examples/resources/custom_dashboard/example_3.tf"}}

See the [orcasecurity_custom_widget](custom_widget.md) resource for full schema and more examples (table-type, alert widgets, etc.).

## Importing

Existing dashboards created in the Orca UI can be imported into Terraform.

**Get the dashboard ID:** Open the dashboard in the Orca UI and check the URL. The dashboard ID (preference ID) appears in the URL path.

**Import command:**

```bash
terraform import orcasecurity_custom_dashboard.<resource_name> <dashboard_id>
```

Example:

```bash
terraform import orcasecurity_custom_dashboard.my_dashboard abc123-def456-ghi789
```

Add a placeholder resource block to your configuration first, then run the import. After import, run `terraform plan` to align your configuration with the imported state.
