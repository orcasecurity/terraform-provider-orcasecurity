Provides a custom sonar-based alert.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# simple sonar-based custom alert
resource "orcasecurity_custom_sonar_alert" "example" {
  name          = "Azure VNets that aren't in use"
  description   = "Azure VNets that don't have any compute or data resources attached to them via NICs."
  rule          = "AzureVNet with NetworkInterfaces"
  orca_score    = 6.2
  category      = "Network misconfigurations"
  context_score = false
}

# sonar-based custom alert with remediation steps
resource "orcasecurity_custom_sonar_alert" "example" {
  name          = "Azure VNets that aren't in use"
  description   = "Azure VNets that don't have any compute or data resources attached to them via NICs."
  rule          = "AzureVNet with NetworkInterfaces"
  orca_score    = 6.2
  category      = "Network misconfigurations"
  context_score = false
  remediation_text = {
    enable = true
    text   = "Add resources to this VNet via a network interface or delete this VNet."
  }
}

# sonar-based custom alert with custom compliance frameworks associations
resource "orcasecurity_custom_sonar_alert" "example" {
  name          = "Azure VNets that aren't in use"
  description   = "Azure VNets that don't have any compute or data resources attached to them via NICs."
  rule          = "AzureVNet with NetworkInterfaces"
  orca_score    = 6.2
  category      = "Network misconfigurations"
  context_score = false
  compliance_frameworks = [
    { name = "framework 1 name", section = "framework 1 section", priority = "low" },
