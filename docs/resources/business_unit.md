Please note that a business unit cannot be composed of multiple, different filter types. You cannot compose 1 business unit that uses both cloud tags and custom tags, for example.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Cloud Provider-based Business Unit for AWS and all Shift Left projects
resource "orcasecurity_business_unit" "example" {
  name = "AWS and Shift Left"

  filter_data = {
    cloud_providers = ["aws", "shiftleft"]
  }
}

// Cloud Tag-based Business Unit for All Resources with the Env:Prod tag or Sensitive:True tag.
resource "orcasecurity_business_unit" "BU-Tags" {
  name = "BU-Tags"

  filter_data = {
    cloud_tags = [
      "Orca|True"
    ]
  }
}

// Cloud Provider-based Business Unit for AWS and all Shift Left projects
resource "orcasecurity_business_unit" "BU-OrcaTags" {

## Schema

### Required

### Optional

- `shiftleft_filter_data` (Attributes) The filter to select Shift Left resources for the business unit. If you are creating a BU that only includes Shift Left resources (projects), this can be safely excluded. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--shiftleft_filter_data))
