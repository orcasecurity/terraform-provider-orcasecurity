# orcasecurity_custom_dashboard (Resource)

Provides a custom dashboard resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Dashboard with built-in widgets only.
# Built-in IDs are strings from Orca docs (e.g. "cloud-accounts-inventory").
resource "orcasecurity_custom_dashboard" "tf-custom-dash-1" {
  name               = "Orca Custom Dashboard 1"
  filter_data        = {}
  organization_level = true
  view_type          = "dashboard"
  extra_params = {
    description = "my 1st simple dashboard"
    widgets_config = [
      {
        id   = "cloud-accounts-inventory"
        size = "sm"
      },
      {
        id   = "security-score-benchmark"
        size = "md"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Built-in Widget IDs

Use these IDs in `widgets_config` when adding Orca built-in widgets to a dashboard. Widget IDs are slugified versions of the names from [Orca Dashboard Widgets (V1)](https://docs.orcasecurity.io/v1/docs/available-dashboard-widgets) and [V2](https://docs.orcasecurity.io/docs/orca-dashboard-widgets-new). For custom widgets, use the `id` attribute of an `orcasecurity_custom_widget` resource.

For widgets, derive the ID by converting the name to lowercase and replacing spaces with hyphens (e.g., "Top Sensitive Data Findings" → `top-sensitive-data-findings`).

## Using Custom Widgets

Custom widgets are created with the `orcasecurity_custom_widget` resource. The widget receives an `id` from Orca after creation (computed attribute). You can mix built-in and custom widgets in the same dashboard:

| Type    | How to reference in `widgets_config`                          |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Built-in | String ID from Orca UI, e.g. `"cloud-accounts-inventory"`   |
| Custom   | `orcasecurity_custom_widget.<resource_name>.id`               |

**1. Create the custom widget:**

```terraform
resource "orcasecurity_custom_widget" "my_widget" {
  name               = "My Custom Widget"
  organization_level = true
  extra_params = {
    type                = "donut"
    empty_state_message = "No data found"
    default_size        = "sm"
    is_new              = true
    subtitle            = ""
    description         = ""
    settings = {
      columns = ["alert", "asset"]
      request_params = {
        query = jsonencode({
          keys   = ["Alert"]
          type   = "object_set"
          models = ["Alert"]
        })
        group_by      = ["RiskLevel"]
        group_by_list = ["RiskLevel"]
      }
      field = { name = "RiskLevel", type = "str" }
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Add it to a dashboard using its `id`:**

```terraform
# Mix built-in widgets (string IDs) and custom widgets (resource IDs).
# Built-in: use string ID from Orca docs. Custom: use orcasecurity_custom_widget.<name>.id
resource "orcasecurity_custom_dashboard" "my_dashboard" {
  name               = "Dashboard with Built-in and Custom Widgets"
  organization_level = true
  filter_data        = {}
  view_type          = "dashboard"
  extra_params = {
    description = "Built-in and custom widgets together"
    widgets_config = [
      # Built-in widgets — string IDs from Orca docs
      { id = "cloud-accounts-inventory", size = "sm" },
      { id = "security-score-benchmark", size = "md" },
      { id = "alerts-by-severity", size = "sm" },
      # Custom widget — reference the resource
      { id = orcasecurity_custom_widget.my_widget.id, size = "sm" }
    ]
  }
}
```

See the [orcasecurity_custom_widget](custom_widget.md) resource for full schema and more examples (table-type, alert widgets, etc.).

## Importing

Existing dashboards created in the Orca UI can be imported into Terraform.

**Get the dashboard ID:** Open the dashboard in the Orca UI and check the URL. The dashboard ID (preference ID) appears in the URL path.

**Import command:**

```bash
terraform import orcasecurity_custom_dashboard.<resource_name> <dashboard_id>
```

Example:

```bash
terraform import orcasecurity_custom_dashboard.my_dashboard abc123-def456-ghi789
```

Add a placeholder resource block to your configuration first, then run the import. After import, run `terraform plan` to align your configuration with the imported state.
